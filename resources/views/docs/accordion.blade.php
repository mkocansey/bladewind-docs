                BladewindUI is a collection of super simple but elegant Laravel blade-based UI components using TailwindCSS and vanilla Javascript. When I decided to move away from JQuery, that indirectly meant I had to find an alternative to the lovely Semantic UI components I had gotten so used to. Well, that was how these components were born.
